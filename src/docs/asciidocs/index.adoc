[[sumary]]
= Sumary
In this module we were able to create an API using Spring Framework with its modules Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA and Spring REST Docs, 
we also used dependencies as Mockito to tests, lombok for the annotations and mapstruct to map the clases. Our proyect was build in Maven.


[[http-verbs]]
== HTTP Verbs (CRUD operations)

In this course we have tried to stich as much as posible to the RESTful standard, taking advantage of all the 
capabilities of the HTTP protocol and following the HTTP rules using the HTTP verbs. 


|===
| Verb | Use

| `GET`
| Recover a resource


| `POST`
| Creat a new resource

| `PUT`
| Update an existence resource, including partial updates.

| `DELETE`
| Delete a resource
